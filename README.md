- Hello! My name is Jonathan Duffy and I am
a graduate from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte
majoring in computer science with a concentration in
systems, software, and networks. I am currently seeking 
employment opportunities or internships following my
graduation in May of 2021. This portfolio serves to
display all my current or past projects that I have worked
on during the course of my education, and I encourage you
to look into them to see some of my work. Hope you enjoy
and if you have any questions feel free to reach out to me
at jduffy456@gmail.com!
